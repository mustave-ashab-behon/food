      <h1>Usefullness of Coffee</h1>
      <p>When people think of coffee, <br /> they usually think of its ability to provide an energy boost. <br /> However, according to some research, it can also offer some other important health benefits, <br /> such as a lower risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.</p>

     <h2>Black Coffee</h2>
     <p>Simply put, black coffee is a combination of water and coffee without any milk. You should serve it without any added flavors such as honey, cream, and milk. The addition of these products changes the aroma and color of the coffee, turning it lighter-brown or white.</p></div>

       <h2>Aeropress Coffee</h2>
     <p>To make this type of coffee, you need to use an AeroPress device. The process looks like this: you place a paper filter or metal filter in the tube, steep the coffee for less than a minute, and then press it through the filter with a plunger. Thanks to the filter that stops oil and sediment from entering the cup, this coffee has a distinctive taste.</p>

    <div class="div-box-2"> <h2>Latte</h2>
     <p>A Caff√® latte is different from cappuccino because it contains a lot of milk, while cappuccino preserves the stronger espresso taste. A Latte is not the same things as a flat white however, which is a common misconception. Flat whites have much less foamed milk/bubbles.</p>
